# Specifically, it enables CodeSonar warning classes that
# - correspond to MISRA C:2012 rules, AND
# - have checks that are compatible with incremental build/analysis.


# Configuration settings required by one or more MISRA checks.

# Explicitly enable all warning classes that correspond to one or more
# MISRA C:2012 rules AND are compatible with incremental
# build/analysis, for C compilation units.
#
# (If any of these classes is already enabled for C++ compilation
# units, it will remain enabled.)
#
# - Some of the the MISRA-related classes are enabled by default, but
#   others are not. Classes that are enabled by default are indicated with a
#   comment directly above the WARNING_FILTER setting.
# - If you also want to enable a class for C++ compilation units,
